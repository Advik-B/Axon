## What is Axon?

Tired of boilerplate? Teaching a new programmer? Want to *see* your logic?

**Axon** is your answer. Unlike toy block-based languages, Axon is designed for serious development. It provides a structured, visual environment to design complex systems, which it then transpiles directly into clean, human-readable, and performant Go code.

It‚Äôs the clarity of flowcharts with the power of a compiled language.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Axon Workflow

Axon is built around a simple, powerful command-line interface.

### 1. Design: Create a `.ax` file

Define your logic in a simple JSON format. This example creates two constants, adds them, and prints the result.

**`add.ax`**
```json
{
  "id": "basic-addition-v2",
  "name": "Add Numbers with Execution Prototyping**: Build and test complex logic in minutes.
-   **Visual Learners**: Understand your application's architecture at a glance.
-   **Teaching Go**: Introduce core programming concepts without the steep learning curve of textual code.
-   **Complex Systems**: Design intricate data pipelines and concurrent workflows intuitively.
-   **Team Collaboration**: Share and version-control your logic in a clean, human-readable format.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Visual by Design**: Construct programs by connecting nodes. What you see is what you get.
-   **Transpiles to Idiomatic Go**: Generates clean, human-readable, and performant Go code. No black boxes.
-   **Interactive Physics Preview**: Launch a dynamic, interactive visualization of your graph with the `preview` command.
-   **Git-Friendly Format**: Uses a human-readable `.ax` (JSON) format, making version control and collaboration seamless.
-   **Full Go Integration**: Use any function from the Go standard library or your own custom packages.
-   **Multiple File Formats**: Choose between human-readable JSON (`.ax`), commented YAML (`.axd`), high-performance binary (`.axb`), or compressed archives (`.axc`).
-   **Powerful CLI**: A comprehensive command-line interface to build, convert, pack, and preview your graphs.

## üîß How It Works

Design your logic visually in an `.ax` file, which represents nodes and their connections (edges). Axon's transpiler then walks this graph to generate a `main.go` file.

#### 1. The Visual Graph (`add.ax`)

```json
{
  "id": "basic-addition-v2",
  "name": "Add Numbers with Execution Flow",
  "imports": ["fmt"],
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "start", "type": "START" },
    { "id": "const1", "type": "CONSTANT", "label": "x", "config": { "value": "5" }, ... },
    { "id": "const2", "type": "CONSTANT", "label": "y", "config": { "value": "3" }, ... },
    { "id": "sum", "type": "OPERATOR", "label": "z", "config": { "op": "+" }, ... },
    { "id": "printer", "type": "FUNCTION", "impl_reference": "fmt.Println", ... },
    { "id": "end", "type": "END" }
  ],
  "data_edges": [
    { "from_node_id": "const1", "to_node_id": "sum", ... },
    { "from_node_id": "const2", "to_node_id": "sum", ... },
    { "from_node_id": "sum", "to_node_id": "printer", ... }
  ],
  "exec_edges": [
    { "from_node_id": "start", "to_node_id": "sum" },
    { "from_node_id": "sum", "to_node_id": "printer" },
    { "from_node_id": "printer", "to_node_id": "end" }
 Flow",
  "imports": ["fmt"],
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "start", "type": "START" },
    { "id": "end", "type": "END" },
    { "id": "const1", "type": "CONSTANT", "label": "x", "outputs": [{ "type_name": "int" }], "config": { "value": "5" }},
    { "id": "const2", "type": "CONSTANT", "label": "y", "outputs": [{ "type_name": "int" }], "config": { "value": "3" }},
    { "id": "sum", "type": "OPERATOR", "label": "z", "inputs": [{ "name": "a", "type_name": "int" }, { "name": "b", "type_name": "int" }], "outputs": [{ "type_name": "int" }], "config": { "op": "+" }},
    { "id": "printer", "type": "FUNCTION", "label": "PrintResult", "impl_reference": "fmt.Println", "inputs": [{ "name": "a", "type_name": "int" }] }
  ],
  "data_edges": [
    { "from_node_id": "const1", "from_port": "out", "to_node_id": "sum", "to_port": "a" },
    { "from_node_id": "const2", "from_port": "out", "to_node_id": "sum", "to_port": "b" },
    { "from_node_id": "sum", "from_port": "out", "to_node_id": "printer", "to_port": "a" }
  ],
  "exec_edges": [
    { "from_node_id": "start", "to_node_id": "sum" },
    { "from_node_id": "sum", "to_node_id": "printer" },
    { "from_node_id": "printer", "to_node_id": "end" }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Visualize: Preview your graph

Before compiling, see your graph come to life!

```bash
axon preview examples/add.ax
```

This launches the interactive, physics-based previewer where you can pan, zoom, and drag nodes.

### 3. Build: Transpile to Go

When you're ready, transpile your visual graph into a real Go program.

```bash
axon build examples/add.ax
```

This generates the following clean Go code in `out/main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	z := 5 + 3
	fmt.Println(z)
}
```

### 4. Run: Execute your code

Run your new Go program just like any other.

```bash
go run out/main.go
# Output: 8
```

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.24 or later)
-   [Protocol Buffers Compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) (`protoc`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash  ]
}
```

#### 2. The Transpiler (`axon build`)

The `build` command processes the graph, follows the execution and data edges, and generates Go code.

#### 3. The Go Output (`out/main.go`)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 5
	y := 3
	z := x + y
	fmt.Println(z)
}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

You need `Go` and `protoc` installed on your system.

### 2. Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Advik-B/Axon.git
cd Axon

# Install dependencies and tools
make install-deps

# Build the Axon CLI
make build
```

### 3. Build Your First Graph

Transpile one of the example graphs into Go code.

```bash
./axon build examples/add.ax
```

This will generate `out/main.go`.

### 4. Run the Output

```bash
go run out/main.go
# Output: 8
```

### 5. Preview it!

Launch the interactive physics-based preview.

```bash
./axon preview examples/add.ax
```
